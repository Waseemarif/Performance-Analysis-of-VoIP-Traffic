# Performance-Analysis-of-VoIP-Traffic
For this project we are using NS2 to implement our VoIP network. We will be setting up several nodes on either side of two routers. We are going to be using an exponential traffic source to re-create a typical voice conversation over VoIP. Different protocols will be used to send voice information between terminals, starting with User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP). We are going to be measuring packet loss, throughput, end-to-end delay, and if the protocol permits, jitter. We will be plotting our results and comparing them to our theory based predictions.
